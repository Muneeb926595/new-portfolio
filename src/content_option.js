    title: "Senior Mobile App Engineer at ScalaMed (Cardinal Health) ",
    description: "During my tenure at ScalaMed, a US-based product recently acquired by Cardinal Health, I gained extensive experience and took on various roles, utilizing cutting-edge technologies. I actively participated in design discussions, shaping application architecture, and implementing new features. Notably, I successfully transformed an expo-based app to bare React Native, achieving a bug-free app through the use of the MST state library and Jest for Test Driven Development. I significantly improved app performance, reduced load time, integrated React Native debugging tools, expanded the user base with multi-language support, and enhanced the UI. Following agile methodologies, I ensured meticulous planning, coding, and debugging, prioritized security compliance, implemented code push for OTA updates, and deployed applications to app stores. Throughout my time at ScalaMed, I demonstrated adaptability and technical prowess, achieving performance improvements, integrating essential debugging tools, expanding the user base, and refining the UI. I oversaw the software development lifecycle, collaborated with stakeholders, upheld security compliance, and implemented efficient over-the-air updates. My outstanding contributions earned me nominations for Employee of the Month and Best Performance of the Year.",

    title: "Full Stack Mobile & Web Developer | Team Leader",
    description: "During my 1.5-year tenure at my current organization, I have gained extensive experience in diverse roles and technologies. I have designed, developed, and modified over 15 software systems, showcasing my proficiency in software development. With my skills in React Native, I have created visually appealing and user-friendly applications by developing pixel-perfect user interfaces. Collaboration has been a key aspect of my work, as I have effectively worked with project managers, quality assurance testers, and the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) to deliver high-quality projects. I have also empowered and upskilled staff members, enabling them to make independent updates. Additionally, I have successfully managed time-sensitive updates for live production sites and apps, ensuring their smooth functioning. I have overcome limitations in React Native by developing native modules from scratch, expanding the functionality of the applications.      In my role, I have prioritized web application security, resolved bugs, and enhanced functionality to improve the overall user experience. As a project overseer, I have managed the entire software development lifecycle, meeting deadlines and achieving organizational objectives. Client satisfaction has been central to my work, and I have streamlined the development and deployment processes for efficient updates and deployments.",
