      "During my tenure at ScalaMed, a US-based product recently acquired by Cardinal Health, I gained extensive experience and took on various roles, utilizing cutting-edge technologies. I actively participated in design discussions, shaping application architecture, and implementing new features. Notably, I successfully transformed an expo-based app to bare React Native, achieving a bug-free app through the use of the MST state library and Jest for Test Driven Development. I significantly improved app performance, reduced load time, integrated React Native debugging tools, expanded the user base with multi-language support, and enhanced the UI. Following agile methodologies, I ensured meticulous planning, coding, and debugging, prioritized security compliance, implemented code push for OTA updates, and deployed applications to app stores. Throughout my time at ScalaMed, I demonstrated adaptability and technical prowess, achieving performance improvements, integrating essential debugging tools, expanding the user base, and refining the UI. I oversaw the software development lifecycle, collaborated with stakeholders, upheld security compliance, and implemented efficient over-the-air updates. My outstanding contributions earned me nominations for Employee of the Month and Best Performance of the Year.",
